# Leveraging Machine Learning Models for Healthcare Improvement  

This repository explores how machine learning (ML) can enhance healthcare decision-making by predicting key outcomes. It includes three use cases that demonstrate ML’s potential in improving patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and resource management.  

## Use Cases  
- **Predicting Cell Malignancy** – Assists in early cancer detection.  
- **Assessing Heart Disease Risk** – Supports preventive care and early intervention.  
- **Forecasting Patient No-Shows** – Helps optimize appointment scheduling and resource allocation.  

<!-- ## Repository Structure  
- `data/` – Contains sample datasets used for training and evaluation.  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with model implementations and analysis.  
- `models/` – Saved ML models and relevant scripts.  
- `reports/` – Documentation and findings.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name -->
